I'm an astrophysicist interested in the way planets and stars are put together and live out their lives. I'm especially interested in the role played by fluid stability and rotation in these objects, and the related question of how these objects naturally pulsate.

I started as NASA Postdoc at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][jpl] in Fall 2023. Before that I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Planetary Science at [Caltech GPS][gps].

In 2019 I defended my PhD at the University of California Santa Cruz where I focused on the mysterious interiors of the gas giants in our own solar system, Jupiter and Saturn. I build computer simulations of the structure and evolution of these bodies to help interpret the wealth of observations made as part of campaigns like NASA's [Cassini][cassini] and [Juno][juno] missions.

The research my collaborators and I did studying Saturn's core structure using its rings as a seismograph made the news at [Caltech][caltechstory2021], [NYT][nytstory2021], and [National Geographic][natgeostory] in 2021. Our 2019 paper focusing on Saturn's rotation was picked up by [NASA/JPL][nasastory], [UCSC][ucscstory], [space.com][spacestory], [astronomy.com][astronomystory], [Science News][sciencestory], [Cosmos][cosmosstory], and [the New York Times][nytstory].
